\subsection{Detailed Description}
The game header file

This is the place where all of the current pieces from the game board are stored; it also includes the scores of eacher player, which indicates how many pieces a player has left on the board. All of the methods that are required for the game logic are stored in this file as well. It makes it much easier to maintain the information for the games moves here rather than keeping the information with the computational parts of the application.
